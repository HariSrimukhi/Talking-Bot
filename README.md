# Talking-Bot
The “Talking Bot Project” involves developing an interactive chatbot utilizing a custom API created with AI Studio API. For speech-to-text capabilities, it integrates (OpenAI's) advanced recognition technology, allowing the bot to understand spoken language. Text-to-speech functionality is implemented using (pyttsx3), a Python library that converts text into natural-sounding speech. This setup ensures smooth, real-time communication between users and the bot, enhancing its usability and interaction quality.
